# Conclusions
Adrian Rosebrock hoped you will join him to keep learning new topics each week, including videos of his explaining computer vision and deep learning, at http://pyimg.co/bookweeklylearning.

Learning optical character recognition (OCR) is not easy (if it were, this book wouldn’t exist!).

You took the bull by the horns, fought some tough battles, and came out victorious.

Let’s take a second to recap your newfound knowledge. Inside this bundle you’ve learned how
to:
1. Train your custom Keras/TensorFlow deep learning OCR models
1. Perform handwriting recognition with Keras and TensorFlow
1. Use machine learning to denoise images to improve OCR accuracy
1. Perform image/document alignment and registration
1. Build on the image/document alignment to OCR structured documents, including forms,
invoices, etc.
1. Use OCR to automatically solve sudoku puzzles
1. Create a project to OCR receipts, pulling out the item names and prices
1. Build an automatic license/number plate recognition (ALPR/ANPR) system
1. Detect (and discard) blurry text in images
1. Use our blurry text detector implementation to OCR real-time video streams
1. Leverage GPUs to improve the text detection speed of deep learning models
1. Connect to cloud-based OCR engines including Amazon Rekognition API, Microsoft
Cognitive Services, and the Google Cloud Vision API
1. Train and fine-tune Tesseract models on your custom datasets
1. Use the EasyOCR Python package, which as the name suggests, makes working with
text detection and OCR easy
1. . . . and much more!

Each of these projects was challenging and representative of the types of techniques and
algorithms you’ll need when solving real-world OCR problems.

Complex fields such as computer vision, deep learning, and OCR will never obtain “perfect”
accuracy. In fact, researchers are often wary of “100% accuracy” as that’s often a sign of a
model overfitting to a specific problem, and therefore being unable to generalize to other use
cases.

Use the same approach when implementing your projects. Attack the problem head-on using
the knowledge gained from this book. Accept a tolerance of error. Be patient. And then
*consistently* and *unrelentingly* iterate until you fall within your error tolerance bounds.

**The key here is patience.** I’m not a patient person, and more than likely, you aren’t patient
either. But there are times when you need to step away from your keyboard, go for a walk, and
just let your mind relax from the problem. It’s there that new ideas will form, creativity will
spark, and you’ll have that “Ah-ha!” moment where the light bulb flips on, and you see the
solution.

##　Where to Now?

Optical character recognition is a subfield of computer vision that also overlaps with deep
learning. There are new OCR algorithms and techniques published daily. The hands-down,
best way to progress is to work on your projects with some help.

Adrian Rosebrock created weekly video updates, pre-configured Juypter Notebooks on Colab, and code
downloads to help professionals, researchers, students, and hackers achieve their goals. Adrian Rosebrock
hope you will take a moment visit it here http://pyimg.co/bookweeklylearning. Adrian Rosebrock think it is the
only place for you to have a real PhD serve as your guide with new videos and resources
published each week. He's honestly kicking myself for not having done this earlier.

* `http://pyimg.co/bookweeklylearning` : It's the perfect mix of theory, video
explanation, pre-configured Jupyter Notebooks on Colab to help everyone achieve their goals.

To keep up with OCR implementations, Adrian Rosebrock suggest you follow the PyImageSearch blog
(http://pyimg.co/blog), and more specifically, the “**Optical Character Recognition**” topic
(http://pyimg.co/blogocr), which provides a curated list of all OCR topics I’ve published.


To keep up with trends in both the deep learning and machine learning fields, Adrian Rosebrock highly suggest
following ``/r/machinelearning`` and ``/r/deeplearning`` on Reddit:

* http://pyimg.co/g2vb0

If you are a LinkedIn user, join the Computer Vision Online and Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition groups, respectively:

* http://pyimg.co/6ep60

If you’re a researcher, I suggest you use Andrej Karpathy’s Arxiv Sanity Preserver
(https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/), which you can use to find papers on optical character recognition.
As a researcher, you’ll want to keep up with the state-of-the-art in the field.
