### We have a simple project structure for this tutorial consisting of the following images:
* ``scans/``: Contains two JPG testing photos of a tax form
* ``form_w4.png``: Our template image of the official 2020 IRS W-4 form

Additionally, weâ€™ll be reviewing two Python files:
* ``align_images.py``: Holds our helper function which aligns a scan to a template by means of an OpenCV pipeline
* ``align_document.py``: Our driver file in the main directory which brings all the pieces together to perform image alignment and registration with OpenCV
